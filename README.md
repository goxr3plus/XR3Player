# Attention for future contributors  
Check the section **HOW TO RUN PROJECT** because it needs just  20 seconds of adding some extra VM parameters .

# HOW TO RUN PROJECT 

To build XR3Player, you will need: 

* [JDK 21]
* [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) - Version 3.8.1++

Open IntelliJ and fork the project (https://github.com/goxr3plus/XR3Player).

![2019-08-01_18-04-22](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20374208/62304551-d5f91900-b486-11e9-80e9-cf802d91ee6f.gif)

In order to run the project you should add the following **VM Options** ( easy using IntelliJ , Eclipse or Netbeans ) :

```
--add-exports javafx.controls/com.sun.javafx.scene.control.behavior=com.jfoenix
--add-exports javafx.controls/com.sun.javafx.scene.control=com.jfoenix
--add-exports javafx.base/com.sun.javafx.binding=com.jfoenix
--add-exports javafx.graphics/com.sun.javafx.stage=com.jfoenix
--add-exports javafx.base/com.sun.javafx.event=com.jfoenix
--add-exports javafx.graphics/com.sun.javafx.scene=org.controlsfx.controls,
--add-exports javafx.graphics/com.sun.javafx.scene.traversal=org.controlsfx.controls
```

Ready to go :) 

This is only for me when i build the new installers ( i wrote this to not forget in future )

How i package for the installer : ```Maven clean``` and then ```Maven package``` from the lifecycles .

It prepares a ```XR3Player_lib``` and a ```XR3Player.jar``` and it copies then using the assemply into a zip called XR3Player Update xxx . zip

## QUESTIONS
<details>
  <summary>System Requirements</summary>
  <p>
   
    1) At least 4 Cores CPU > 2.0 GHZ CPU Intel or AMD 
     
    2) A good GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) [ It requires graphic power for visualizers ]

    3) At least 4GB DDR3|DDR4 Ram [ Java Programs are known to consume a little bit more RAM ;) ]
